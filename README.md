## Project Setup

**You must have at least v20.0.0 of Node.js installed.**

Fork the repo to get your own copy and clone it to your local system.

In the root of the project directory, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install
```

The project uses Vite as the build tool for a fast and lean development experience.

To start a local dev server, use the script:

```
npm run dev
```

Or use this script to expose it on the device's network (in order to view the project on other devices such as mobile phones and tablets):

```
npm run dev -- --host
```

To run the build command that bundles the code for production, use the script:

```
npm run build
```
